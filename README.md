## About the project

<p style="text-align:justify">For my thesis, I chose to develop a community site, a portal to facilitate the collaboration of music artists, where users can easily share music and build relationships. Due to my musical hobby, I have had the opportunity of working with other performers. Sadly, all the music sharing, discussion and project sharing has been done through several dedicated websites or applications. My web application aims to eliminate the need to use multiple platforms, thus facilitating discussion, music sharing, news sharing and building a follower base among other performers. I have created a platform independent web application that helps performers to work together, get to know each other, by allowing them to share music projects, sounds, and to move work quickly and efficiently within a platform, allowing instant messaging, in addition to the traditional music/video player and image viewer. No need to send and receive files across 2-3 interfaces or enquire about each other's work. At the start, I will describe the technologies used and the project history. Later, I will describe the responsive graphic design of the website, the underlying database and the features that registered and non-registered users can use. And after the features have been developed, I will give an insight into the testing process and the further plans I have for the project. </p>
